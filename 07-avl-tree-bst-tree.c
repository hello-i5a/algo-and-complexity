Refresher Concepts
Lists == Linear
Tree == Non-linear

NOTE:
* Review tree terminologies from DSA Summer Term


Binary Search Tree Concepts
Binary Search Tree (BST): A tree that has at most 2 children nodes for each parent node
                            LC < P < RC
Operation (i.e. insertion, deletion, search) time complexity: O(log n) average-case while O(n) for the worst-case
    Tree becomes unbalanced == Worst-case time complexity


AVL Tree Concepts
AVL Tree: A binary search tree (BST) that is self-balancing.
Balance factor: -1, 0 or 1 for every node
                To maintain the O(log n) time complexity for insertion, deletion and search operations
