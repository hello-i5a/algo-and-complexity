/*
Elementary Sorting Algorithms
1. Bubble sort
2. Selection sort
3. Insertion sort

Sorting -> Process of rearranging elements in a collection
Collection of elements -> Array implementation
Before you sort, you swap -> temporary variable

Bubble sort:
The largest value bubbles (or goes) up to the top (or tail).
    Pseudocode
        * First loop (outer): i -> from N to 0
        * Second loop (inner): j -> from 0 to i-1
        * arr[j] > arr[j + 1] -> swap the two values
If there are N numbers of elements, the total number of passes required to sort it is (N-1).
