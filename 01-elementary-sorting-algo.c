/*
Elementary Sorting Algorithms
1. Bubble sort
2. Selection sort
3. Insertion sort

A collection of elements -> Array implementation
Before you sort, you swap -> temporary variable

Bubble sort:
The largest value bubble up (or goes) to the top (or tail).
* First loop: i -> from N to 0
* Inner loop: j -> from 0 to i-1
* arr[j] > arr[j + 1] -> swap the two values
